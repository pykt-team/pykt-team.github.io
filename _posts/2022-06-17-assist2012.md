The "ASSISTments2012" dataset is a comprehensive collection of educational data from the 2012-2013 school year, with affect predictions. The dataset consists of 2,541,201 interactions, 27,066 students, and 45,716 questions, including information on student interactions with an intelligent tutoring system and is a product of the work of Ryan Baker and his colleagues. The dataset has been used in several scientific studies, including research on affect and knowledge, prediction of state test scores, college enrollment, and college majors. This dataset can be a valuable resource for researchers interested in educational data mining and learning analytics. However, due to the size and complexity of the dataset, working with it may be challenging.
