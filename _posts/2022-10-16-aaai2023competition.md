## AAAI2023 Global Knowledge Tracing Challenge

[Challenge Website](http://ai4ed.cc/competitions/aaai2023competition)

Knowledge tracing (KT) is the task of using studentsâ€™ historical learning interaction data to model their knowledge mastery over time to make predictions on their future interaction performance.

In this competition, we would like to call for researchers and practitioners worldwide to investigate the opportunities to improve student assessment performance via knowledge tracing approaches with rich side information. The total awards are $1900, and the final submission deadline at December 31, 2022.

Your work will help the education system predict students' abilities more accurately and help students learn better and faster. Even better, you'll help build next-generation smart and personalized education.
